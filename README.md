Okay, here's my contribution: This library includes: PVZDB for Thymed Events (LTE) to work Worldmap Vertical Movement Everything included in the RenoJson library and the Blazey library (I give them credit for their contributions)

# PVZDB
Includes the offsets for current versions so that LTE works; do not modify anything.

# Worldmap Vertical Movement
If you want, you can remove it simply by deleting the code and the function.
